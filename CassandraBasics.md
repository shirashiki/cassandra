Excerpt from Hewitt, Eben. Cassandra, The Definite Guide:

“Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed, decentralized, elastically scalable,
highly available, fault-tolerant, tuneably consistent, column-oriented database that
bases its distribution design on Amazon’s Dynamo and its data model on Google’s
Bigtable. Created at Facebook, it is now used at some of the most popular sites on the
Web."
